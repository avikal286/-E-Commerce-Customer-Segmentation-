## 🔍 Data Analysis Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution plots for Age, Income, Spending Score
- Correlation heatmap
- Countplot for categorical features (e.g., Gender)

### 2. Outlier Detection
- Boxplots to detect outliers
- Removed/extreme value treatment

### 3. Feature Encoding
- Label Encoding for Gender, Country, etc.

### 4. Scaling & Normalization
- StandardScaler applied to numerical features
- Preprocessed for clustering algorithms

### 5. Clustering (Segmentation)
- hierarichal clustering with elbow method
- Cluster visualization with scatterplots

### 6. Basic ML Models
- logistic regression Decision Tree & Random Forest for classification
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 📌 Insights Gained

- Customers grouped by similar income/spending behavior
- Key features affecting high-spending customers
- Segments suitable for targeted marketing strategies
